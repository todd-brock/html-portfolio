<h1>Todd's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>Top 3:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>The score is top notch and the art is fucking amazing, because it's fucking Studio Ghibli.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I mean, c'mon, Heath Ledger's Joker is the best rendition, no contest. Also Christopher Nolan knows how to direct a fuckin movie.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>The animation was near revolutionary. It combined a ton of classic techniques with cutting edge rendering software, not to mention beautiful art-style.</p>
